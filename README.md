_Obstacle Avoidance and Goal To Goal Navigation using Coppeliasim(V-REP)...!!!_

[About the Project]()
## 1. About the Project:
   The project is a very basic version of the latest self-driven/ autonomous car technology. At the basic levels, simple obstacle avoidance and goal to goal navigation is   achieved. Detecting the environment around it, the car takes necessary actions. Meanwhile, it orients itself in the direction of the target position after every turn or deviation.
  
  ## i. Tech Stack:
   	Coppeliasim (VRep)

	Lua programming (regular API)

	Model imported: Robotnik summit XL

  ## ii.  Start:
   
   Clone repository:
   
     git clone https://github.com/Git-Saurabh5/Team-Kerbecks-and-PS.git
     
   Open the file final.ttt and Run it.
     
   OR
     
   [Download our project file](https://github.com/Git-Saurabh5/Team-Kerbecks-and-PS/raw/master/final.ttt)
   
   Run the program

## 3.  Usage
## Results and demo:
	Various changes were made in the course of project regarding different number of sensors and their position.
These are as follows:

•	3 sensors placed on the front side of the car: (as mentioned in the above file final.ttt)

•	3 sensors placed on the front side of the car, 2 on either side: ![view image](https://github.com/Git-Saurabh5/Team-Kerbecks-and-PS/tree/master/ImagesForGitHub)
[Download file](https://github.com/Git-Saurabh5/Team-Kerbecks-and-PS/raw/master/sensor5.ttt) OR open the file sensor5.ttt from cloned repository

•	1 sensor placed on a rotating platform placed at the front of the car (this rotating platform performs angular simple harmonic motion):

Based on all these observations we concluded that we would use 3 sensors in the front of the car.

We also tried making the car encounter a C curved obstacle.
